    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>

    <ol style="color: brown;" >
      <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li><br>
      <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in any other media.</li><br>
      <li><span class="text1">CSS is not necessary</span><span class="text2"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</li><br>
      <li class="text3">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li style="color:brown; letter-spacing: 3px;"  >Inline: By Using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
      <li class="text4">Internal: By using style element in the head section.</li>
      <li class="text4">External: By using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
      <li class="text4">The most common way to add CSS is to keep thestyles in external CSS file. However <span class="text2"> in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</span> because this is easier to demonstrate and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the diiference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it is used by JavaScript. </p>
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to targeet a specific element of range on a webpage. Once an elementhas been targeted a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There are a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and Id. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
